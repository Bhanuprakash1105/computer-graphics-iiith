# Experiment Project Documentation

## Introduction
This  document captures the technical details related to the experiment development.

## Project
**Domain Name :** Computer Science & Engineering   

**Lab Name :** Computer Graphics    

**Experiment Name :** Rasterization : Line

In digital display systems, everything that is displayed, is displayed in terms of a smallest unit of display, which is called a pixel. This is in contrast to what we perceive the world to be as continuous. The space occupied by any image in digital display system is measured in terms of pixels.

Thus we require to transform the continuous space in which we define he geometry of any figure to a discrete space for display in digital displays. This transformation is called rasterization or scan conversion

When a line is transformed from its continuous form of y = mx + c into a discrete form of a set of pixels, this transformation is called line rasterization. Thus when we apply line rasterization technique on a line,   y = mx + c, we obtain the set of pixels that are required to be filled in order to fit the given continuous line in the best possible manner.

## Purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to convert the Rasterization : Line experiment simulation from Java to Javascript.

| 3. | Code Documentation | This document captures the  details related to code |

## Process Followed to convert the experiment
1. Understand the assigned experiment Java simulation
2. Understanding the experiment concept
3. Re-implement the same in javascript

## Value Added by our Project
1. It would be beneficial for engineering students
2. Highly beneficial for tier 2 and tier 3 college students who can use this to learn and understand the concept of Rasterization Line. 

## Risks and Challenges
1. Creating a responsive frame on the canvas.
2. Drawing the Rasterization Line, considering the origin at bottom left corner of the canvas frame because by default the origin is present at top left corner of the canvas.
3. Making the Next Iteration and Previos Iterations.
