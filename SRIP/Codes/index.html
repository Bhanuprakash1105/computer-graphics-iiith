				This experiment is designed to teach a hierarchical transformation model.<br>
				The world represented as a tree is shown below. Each node is an instance. Each instance has 3 sections: Coodinate system, shape/instance, Transformation. Coordinate system is the local coordinate system of the instance. Shape/Instance is the geometry or a child instance of the cuurent instance. Multiple shapes and child instances can be added where the child instance is again a node.<br><br>Transformation is the set of transformations applied to the position of structure w.r.t the local coordinate system.
				<br><br>All the values being shown can be edited by clicking on them. Any changes to the tree are reflected on the display and vice-versa.
				<br><br>We constructed a hierarchical articulated arm model where each node/part follows a series of transformations from the root node to its current position. The top-most object in this hierarchy is the Shoulder followed by Elbow, Forearm, Wrist and Palm.</p>
