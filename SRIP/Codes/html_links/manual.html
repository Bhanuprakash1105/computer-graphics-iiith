			<p>After clicking the <b>Start</b> we can observe the content of <b>World Tab</b> in which we can observe the description of the experiment.<br><br>Below we can observe <b>World</b> and <b>Display</b> buttons through which we can shift between the world and display tabs.<br><br>Try the features/options provided in the world figures section.<br><br><b>In the diplay tab many features are available:</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>We have <b>Draw grid XY, YZ</b> and <b>ZX</b> to choose as check boxes and we can choose as per our choice.</li><br>
				<li>The <b>Draw grid XY</b> check box has default checked value but user can choose to check it or not.
				</li><br>
				<li>The distance between two intersection points on the line is same in all the planes.</li><br>
				<li>We have <b>Show Animation</b>  and <b>Remove Animation</b> buttons by which we can see the animation provided and undo the animation.</li><br>
				<li>Transistion feature are available by which we can shift the 3D model to various coordinates.<br> Start the transition with deciaml inputs(specify the zeros also) only ( x, y, z ) = ( 0.5, 1.0, 0.75 ) units of distance for avoiding refershing of the page.</li><br>
				<li>Remember that the x, y and z values which you enter must be the units which will be distance of transistion from the current position</li><br>
				<li>After entering the values click on submit to observe the output.</li>
