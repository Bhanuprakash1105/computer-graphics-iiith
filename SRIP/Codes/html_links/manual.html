				<li>We have <b>Show Animation</b>  and <b>Remove Animation</b> buttons by which we can see the animation provided and undo the animation.</li><br>
				<li>Transistion feature are available by which we can shift the 3D model to various coordinates.<br>** Please start the transition with (x, y, z) = (0.5, 0, 0) units for avoiding refershing of the page **.</li><br>
				<li>Remember that the x, y and z values which you enter must be the units which will be distance of transistion from the current position</li><br>
				<li>After entering the values click on submit to observe the output.</li>
